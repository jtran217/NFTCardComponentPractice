## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./images/Screenshot (2).png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learned that by having a parent container with position relative, a new element with position absolute can be overlayed over the previous element. This opens up a lot of path especially in term of adding new effects to hovers of any elements. 


```css
.img-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    opacity: 0;
}
```

### Continued development
1. Able to comfortably center elements in the middle of the display view.
2. Continue improving in use of flex box to make more complex items.
3. Work on better organizing my code so it has better readability.
